## Readme first

**Languages of this repo**(or my language): Chinese, English, Japanese, German. All the books have links to *douban*, an awesome website of book reviews, albeit held back for political reasons.

**Ideal effect of this repo**: when I want to dive into a subject I can easily find high-quality information here. 

**Philosophy of this repo**: *you are what you read*. This is at least half true (same people same reading very different results), I hope to leave a record of my learning path, and provide some guidances (hopefully) to yet another hacker out there.

### Design of the repo structure (WIP)

As this repo grows bigger and bigger (I can already foresee it being more than 10k lines), manage it well is a pressing problem. Currently working on it. (TODO)

**I am continuously refactoring this repo's structure, and feel free to start a issue for a better scheme.**
 
 
**Naming of sections**: Use verb `be`, `have`, etc. as the starting word to remind yourself that they are all to be mastered.

**Information on the Internet**: Some forms of information are:
  - Book: the most persistent way of conveying knowledge
  - GitHub repo: this enables real time interaction with the author, relatively persistent
  - personal Blogs: held by individuals, persistency typically not guaranteed 
  - Youtube: great video learning resources, relatively persistent but not guaranteed
  - great Article: very insightful articles
  - Article: workds written on websites, often focused on solving some particular problem

**Being an Internet citivzen**: articles and videos in China (where I live in for now) are often not so persistent, it is recommended that you download useful information before they are wiped out. 

We HOPE that what we are writing today will still be there after some decades or even centuries, so host your own articles and treat them well. **Don't be a tenant on the Internet.**
