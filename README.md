## Readme first

My languages: Chinese, English, Japanese. All the books have links to *douban*, an awesome website of book reviewing, albeit held back for political reasons.

Forms of information:
  - book: the most persistent way of conveying knowledge
  - GitHub repo: this enables real time interaction with the author, relatively persistent
  - personal blogs: held by individuals, persistency typically not guaranteed 
  - Youtube: great video learning resources, relatively persistent but not guaranteed

Articles and videos in China are often not so persistent, it is recommended that you download information useful before they are wiped out.
