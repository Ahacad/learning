## Readme first

**Languages of this repo**(or my language): Chinese, English, Japanese, German. All the books have links to *douban*, an awesome website of book reviews, albeit held back for political reasons.

**Ideal effect of this repo**: when I want to dive into a subject I can easily find high-quality information here. 

**Naming of sections**: Use verb `be`, `have`, etc. as the starting word to remind yourself that they are all to be mastered.

**Information on the Internet**: Some forms of information are:
  - book: the most persistent way of conveying knowledge
  - GitHub repo: this enables real time interaction with the author, relatively persistent
  - personal blogs: held by individuals, persistency typically not guaranteed 
  - Youtube: great video learning resources, relatively persistent but not guaranteed
  - great article: very insightful articles
  - article: workds written on websites, often focused on solving some particular problem

Articles and videos in China (where I live in for now) are often not so persistent, it is recommended that you download useful information before they are wiped out. 

We HOPE that what we are writing today will still be there after some decades or even centuries, so host your own articles and treat them well. **Don't be a tenant on the Internet.**
